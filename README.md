Usage
-----
See the source files in src/client/ for example usage. CryptoKernel ships with a Proof of Work coin built-in called K320 that works out of the box. For more information about the API check the documentation.

To launch CryptoKernel as K320 with its default setup, simply write:

```
./ckd
```

To get a list of command line RPC commands use:
```
./ckd help
```

To make ckd run in daemon mode use:
```
./ckd -daemon
```
